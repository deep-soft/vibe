              TLDR: is it crash without errors? Please open `cmd.exe` and run `%localappdata%\vibe\vibe.exe`. transcribe and check errors. Don't see anything? try run `set RUST_LOG=debug` before run.
              macOS: `RUST_LOG=vibe=debug,whisper_rs=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 /Applications/vibe.app/Contents/MacOS/vibe`
              Linux: `RUST_LOG=vibe=debug,whisper_rs=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 vibe`
